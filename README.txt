For context, previous work done at the Integrative Modeling,Perception and Affective CompuTing (IMPACT) lab, run by Dr. Nathaniel Blanchard, in collaboration with the Human Memory lab, run by Dr. Anne Cleary, both at Colorado State University, showed the viability of using machine learning models to predict outcomes of recognition memory processes using eye-gaze data. For information on how this was done please refer to the following papers:

In [1] you can find the methodology used for collecting the eye-gaze dataset. Importantly, on page 9 of [1], you will find the description of the "Virtual Reality Familiarity Dataset" which is the dataset that the subsequent experiments were preformed with. In [2], you will find variations of [1] in the sense that the Chartier [2] conducted experiments, 3 in total, using various subsets and target variables of the Virtual Reality Familiarity Dataset from [1].
